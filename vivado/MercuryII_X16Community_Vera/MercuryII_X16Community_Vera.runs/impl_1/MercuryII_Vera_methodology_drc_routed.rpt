HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) irq direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (irq) connected to this Port, but both were not found.

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell vera0/reset_sync_clk25/dff_r_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) vera0/reset_sync_clk25/dff_r_reg/PRE
vera0/reset_sync_clk25/dff_rr_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities

TIMING-28#1 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint

XDCB-2#1 Warning
Clock defined on multiple objects  
The clock rdclk is defined on multiple objects. Although this is logically functional for timing analysis, it cannot exist in hardware. It is recommended to define a primary clock on a single object.
